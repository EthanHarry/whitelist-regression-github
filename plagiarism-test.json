  "Test": "In machine learning, support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks[1]) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one or the other of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that assigns new examples to one category or the other, making it a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier (although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting). An SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible. New examples are then mapped into that same space and predicted to belong to a category based on which side of the gap they fall.  In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.",
  "Test2": "Nassib joined the Penn State University as a walk-on in 2011.[1][2][3] After not playing his first two years, Nassib played in 10 games as a sophomore in 2013. He recorded 12 tackles and one sack. As a junior, he appeared in all 13 games and had seven tackles and one sack.[4] He became a starter for the first time his senior year in 2015.[5][6][7] Nassib reached 10 sacks in only six games to start the year.[8]",
